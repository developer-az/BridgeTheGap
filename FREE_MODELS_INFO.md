## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Before (Paid Models)
- GPT-3.5 Turbo: ~$0.002 per request
- 100 requests = $0.20
- Could add up quickly!

### After (Free Models)
- **$0.00 per request** ✅
- **50 requests/day = FREE**
- **No charges ever!**

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Free Models Are Limited
- May experience rate limiting during peak times
- 50 requests/day limit (without credits)
- Slightly slower than paid models (but still fast!)

### If You Hit Limits
1. Wait until next day (resets at midnight UTC)
2. Add $10 credits for 1,000 requests/day (still using free models)
3. Use manual form as backup

### Error Handling
If you see `429 Too Many Requests`:
- You've hit the daily limit
- Wait a few hours or until tomorrow
- The app will show helpful error messages

---

## ✅ Verification

To verify you're using free models:

1. Check the code - all defaults use `:free` models
2. Check OpenRouter dashboard - credits should stay at $0
3. Test the schedule parsing - should work without charges
